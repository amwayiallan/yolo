To set up the environment with Vagrant and provision a virtual machine running the latest Ubuntu Server, you would typically follow these steps:

    Install Vagrant and VirtualBox: Ensure you have Vagrant and VirtualBox installed on your system.

    
cd yolo

Initialize Vagrant:

vagrant init ubuntu/focal64

Edit Vagrantfile:

Modify the Vagrantfile to configure the VM to your needs. You can specify memory, CPU, and other settings here.

Start the Virtual Machine:

vagrant up

SSH into the Virtual Machine:

vagrant ssh

Now, regarding the Ansible playbook setup, you would typically follow these steps:

    Create a Playbook:

    Within the root directory of your project, create a playbook file, e.g., playbook.yml.

    Define Tasks:

    Define tasks within the playbook to set up the Docker containers for your web application. Each container should be configured using its own role.

    Use Variables:

    Utilize variables for configurations that might change between environments or roles. You can define variables inline or in separate variable files.

    Implement Roles:

    Organize your playbook using roles. Each role should encapsulate the setup and configuration of a specific component or service.

    Use Blocks and Tags:

    Implement blocks and tags for ease of assessment and to follow good coding practices. Blocks can help in grouping tasks, and tags can be useful for selective execution.

    Clone Code from GitHub:

    Use the git module in Ansible to clone the code from the GitHub repository into the VM.

    Run Necessary Setups:

    Set up the environment within the VM to run the application. This might include installing dependencies, configuring the environment, and starting services.

    Ensure Application Runs Successfully:

    Verify that the application runs successfully by accessing it from the browser.
